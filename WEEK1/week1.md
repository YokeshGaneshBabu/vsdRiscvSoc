# 🚀 VSD SoC Labs — Week 1: RISC-V Toolchain & Debugging

🌟 **Goal:** Set up a RISC-V environment, compile and analyze C programs, explore the ABI, debug with GDB, boot bare-metal ELF on QEMU, use inline assembly, perform memory-mapped I/O, implement a custom linker script, understand start-up code, handle interrupts, and compare RV32IMAC vs RV32IMC.

💻 **Platform:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

## 📋 Overview

This repository documents Week 1 tasks of the VSD SoC Labs, focusing on the RISC-V toolchain, C-to-assembly translation, disassembly, ABI understanding, GDB debugging, bare-metal execution with QEMU and OpenSBI, inline assembly for performance measurement, memory-mapped I/O for GPIO toggling, linker script implementation, start-up code analysis, interrupt handling, and ISA extension comparison. Each task includes commands, code, detailed explanations, issues faced, and screenshot galleries for visual proof. All code is embedded directly in this README for simplicity.

## 📦 Task 1: Toolchain Installation & Verification

**Status:** ![Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-green)

<summary>🎯 Expand to View Task Details</summary>

### Objective
Install and verify the RISC-V GNU toolchain to enable compiling and debugging RISC-V programs on a 32-bit RISC-V architecture.

### 🏛️ Architecture & Platform
- **Architecture**: RISC-V RV32IMC (32-bit base integer, multiply/divide, compressed instructions). This architecture provides a lightweight instruction set for embedded systems, with compressed instructions (C) reducing code size.
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, a stable Linux distribution, used for hosting the toolchain and running QEMU for emulation.

### 🔧 Steps
The goal is to set up the RISC-V GNU toolchain, which includes the compiler (`gcc`), debugger (`gdb`), and utilities (`objdump`, `objcopy`).

1. **Download and Extract the Prebuilt Toolchain**:
   ```bash
   wget https://vsd-labs.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/vsd-labs/riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-Ubuntu.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-Ubuntu.tar.gz
   mv riscv $HOME/riscv
Explanation: Downloads a prebuilt toolchain for RV32IMAC, extracts it, and moves it to $HOME/riscv for easy access.

Update the PATH Environment Variable:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/riscv/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Explanation: Adds the toolchain binaries to the system PATH, ensuring tools like riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc are accessible from the terminal.
Verify the Installation:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb --version
riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump --version
Explanation: Confirms that the gcc compiler, gdb debugger, and objdump disassembler are installed. The prefix riscv32-unknown-elf indicates the target (32-bit RISC-V, ELF format for bare-metal).
⚠️ Issues Faced
glibc Mismatch: The toolchain required a compatible glibc version, resolved by switching to Ubuntu 24.04.
Missing libpython: Some tools depend on Python libraries, fixed by installing via the deadsnakes PPA.
gdb Not Found: The PATH was initially incorrect; fixed by sourcing .bashrc after updating.

✅ Status
Completed: Toolchain successfully installed and verified.
Issues Resolved: All issues (glibc mismatch, libpython, PATH) were fixed, and the setup is fully functional.
