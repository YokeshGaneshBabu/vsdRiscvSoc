# 🚀 VSD SoC Labs — Week 1: RISC-V Toolchain & Debugging

🌟 **Goal:** Set up a RISC-V environment, compile and analyze C programs, explore the ABI, debug with GDB, boot bare-metal ELF on QEMU, use inline assembly, perform memory-mapped I/O, implement a custom linker script, understand start-up code, handle interrupts, and compare RV32IMAC vs RV32IMC.

## 📋 Overview

This repository documents Week 1 tasks of the VSD SoC Labs, focusing on the RISC-V toolchain, C-to-assembly translation, disassembly, ABI understanding, GDB debugging, bare-metal execution with QEMU and OpenSBI, inline assembly for performance measurement, memory-mapped I/O for GPIO toggling, linker script implementation, start-up code analysis, interrupt handling, and ISA extension comparison. Each task includes commands, code, detailed explanations, and issues faced. All code is embedded directly in this README for simplicity.

## 📦 Task 1: Toolchain Installation & Verification

**Status:** <image-card alt="Completed" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-green" ></image-card>

### Objective
Install and verify the RISC-V GNU toolchain to enable compiling and debugging RISC-V programs on a 32-bit RISC-V architecture.

### 🏛️ Architecture & Platform
- **Architecture**: RISC-V RV32IMC (32-bit base integer, multiply/divide, compressed instructions). This architecture provides a lightweight instruction set for embedded systems, with compressed instructions (C) reducing code size.
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, a stable Linux distribution, used for hosting the toolchain and running QEMU for emulation.

### 🔧 Steps
The goal is to set up the RISC-V GNU toolchain, which includes the compiler (`gcc`), debugger (`gdb`), and utilities (`objdump`, `objcopy`).

1. **Download and Extract the Prebuilt Toolchain**:
   ```bash
   wget https://vsd-labs.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/vsd-labs/riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-Ubuntu.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-Ubuntu.tar.gz
   mv riscv $HOME/riscv
Explanation: Downloads a prebuilt toolchain for RV32IMAC, extracts it, and moves it to $HOME/riscv for easy access.

2. **Update the PATH Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=$HOME/riscv/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
Explanation: Adds the toolchain binaries to the system PATH, ensuring tools like riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc are accessible from the terminal.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   ```bash
   riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
   riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb --version
   riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump --version
Explanation: Confirms that the gcc compiler, gdb debugger, and objdump disassembler are installed. The prefix riscv32-unknown-elf indicates the target (32-bit RISC-V, ELF format for bare-metal).

⚠️ **Issues Faced**
- **glibc Mismatch:** The toolchain required a compatible glibc version, resolved by switching to Ubuntu 24.04.
- **Missing libpython:** Some tools depend on Python libraries, fixed by installing via the deadsnakes PPA.
- **gdb Not Found:** The PATH was initially incorrect; fixed by sourcing .bashrc after updating.

✅ **Status**
- **Completed:** Toolchain successfully installed and verified.
- **Issues Resolved:** All issues (glibc mismatch, libpython, PATH) were fixed, and the setup is fully functional.

## 👋 Task 2: Compiling a RISC-V C Program

**Status:** Completed

### Objective
Write, compile, and verify a simple "Hello, RISC-V!" C program to test the toolchain.

### 🏛️ Architecture & Platform
- **Architecture**: RISC-V RV32IMC. The base integer instructions (I) handle basic operations, while compressed instructions (C) optimize for smaller code size.
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, providing the environment for compilation and verification.

  ### 📄 Code
  ```bash
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main() {
       printf("Hello, RISC-V!\n");
    return 0;
   }
Explanation: This program tests the toolchain by printing a message. Since we’re targeting a bare-metal environment, stdio.h functions like printf may not output directly without UART setup (addressed in later tasks). The focus here is on successful compilation.

   ### 🔧 Compile
    ```bash
    riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello.elf hello.c
Explanation: Compiles the C code into an ELF file (hello.elf), a common format for RISC-V bare-metal programs.

   ### 🔍 Verify ELF
    ```bash
    file hello.elf
Explanation: The file command checks the type of the compiled binary, confirming it’s a 32-bit RISC-V ELF executable.

⚠️ **Issues Faced**
- No Output: Expected since there’s no UART setup yet; the program compiles but doesn’t display output.

✅ **Status**
Completed: Program successfully compiled and verified as a 32-bit RISC-V ELF.
