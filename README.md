# VSD-SoC-Labs: RISC-V SoC Design and Development

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This repository documents a 34-week project under the VSD-SoC-Labs initiative, supported by MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, India) and VLSI System Design (VSD), focused on designing and developing a RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC).Week 1 has been completed, marking the beginning of a comprehensive journey through SoC designâ€”from architecture exploration to tapeoutâ€”using open-source tools and the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). The project aims to teach students and engineers the end-to-end process of SoC development, including bare-metal programming, RTL design, synthesis, verification, and silicon tapeout. Key objectives include mastering the RISC-V ISA, implementing a functional RISC-V core, integrating peripherals, and preparing a manufacturable layout. The project leverages the VSDSquadron board (a RISC-V development platform by VSD) and open-source EDA tools like QEMU, Verilator, and Qflow, aligning with VSDâ€™s mission to democratize VLSI education. It targets the RV32IMAC architecture and is executed on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with QEMU for simulation.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Structure

This 34-week project is divided into weekly milestones, each focusing on a specific aspect of RISC-V SoC design and development. Below is the week-by-week breakdown, with links to detailed documentation for each week (where available). Currently, only Week 1 has been completed. Screenshots for each week are stored in the `screenshots/` directory, organized by week (e.g., `screenshots/week1/`).

### Week-by-Week Breakdown

- **Week 1: Bare-Metal RISC-V Programming Basics**  
  [Link to Week 1 README](WEEK1/week1.md)  
  Focused on setting up the RISC-V toolchain, writing and debugging bare-metal programs, implementing atomic operations, and verifying endianness on RV32IMAC using QEMU.

- **Weeks 2â€“34: Upcoming Milestones**  
  To be updated as the project progresses. Future weeks will cover topics such as RISC-V ISA deep dive, RTL design, synthesis, verification, SoC integration, and tapeout preparation, culminating in a fully functional RISC-V SoC.
